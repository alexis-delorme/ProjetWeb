# ProjetWeb
Projet Web du groupe D - Am√©rique du nord

1. Make sure you downloadd git

2. Go to folder where you want to add repository

3. Write `git clone https://github.com/alexis-delorme/ProjetWeb.git` in terminal

### Working on the code 

1. Go to master-branch `git checkout master`. 
2. Pull latest changes `git pull`. Gets the latest version of the current(master) branch from github
3. Create a new branch `git checkout -b my-branch-name`. Replace my-branch-name with the name of your branch. CANNOT have spaces in its name.
4. Add some code.
5. Commit your changes `git commit -am "Added these cool features"`. These commits will appear in the branch you're currently in (my-branch-name), this way you don't bother anyone else working with another feature. Commit as many times as you want in your branch.
6. Push your commit `git push origin my-branch-name`. This pushes/saves your local commit to github and everyone else can see your changes. The part with `origin my-branch-name` is only needed for the first time you push your branch.
7. Go to github and create a Pull request with your changes to master!
